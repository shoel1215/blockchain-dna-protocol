# Blockchain DNA (bDNA) Protocol

Blockchain DNA (bDNA) is an open, non-profit protocol for converting raw human DNA sequencing output into privacy-preserving, blockchain-verifiable cryptographic objects.

The protocol enables the secure processing of genomic data at the point of sequencing, the creation of encrypted genomic commitments, and the anchoring of compact integrity proofs on a blockchain. All raw genetic data remains encrypted and stored off-chain.

This repository currently contains early-stage protocol documentation and architectural materials. Code implementations are intentionally minimal at this stage and will be developed as the specification matures.

## Scope
- Cryptographic commitments over genomic data
- Zero-knowledge verification of genomic claims
- Off-chain encrypted data storage with on-chain integrity anchoring
- Implementation-agnostic protocol design

## Status
Conceptual design and specification phase.

## Governance
The bDNA protocol is developed under non-profit governance as an open public standard. All materials in this repository are intended to remain open, implementation-neutral, and freely usable.

## License
Apache License 2.0 (proposed; subject to final foundation approval).
