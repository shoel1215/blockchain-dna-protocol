# Protocol Overview

Blockchain DNA (bDNA) defines a cryptographic protocol for transforming raw genomic sequencing data into verifiable, privacy-preserving digital objects.

At a high level, genomic data is processed at the point of sequencing within a trusted execution environment. The data is encrypted, committed to using cryptographic hashing, and represented on-chain only by compact integrity commitments. Verification of genomic claims is performed using cryptographic proofs without disclosure of raw genetic material.

The protocol is blockchain-agnostic and focuses on minimal on-chain data, long-term verifiability, and strict privacy guarantees.

This document provides a conceptual overview; detailed specifications will be developed in subsequent iterations.
