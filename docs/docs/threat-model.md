# Threat Model (Draft)

The bDNA protocol is designed to address the following threat classes:

- Unauthorized access to raw genomic data
- Data tampering or substitution after sequencing
- Centralized database compromise
- Linkage and re-identification attacks
- Malicious or compromised sequencing environments

The protocol assumes:
- Standard cryptographic primitives remain secure
- Trusted execution environments enforce data handling guarantees
- Blockchain consensus provides immutability of commitments

This threat model is preliminary and will be refined as the protocol specification evolves.
